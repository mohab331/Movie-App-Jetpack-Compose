# 🎬 MovieApp – Jetpack Compose Movie Browser (Mock Showcase)

**MovieApp** is a **demo Android app** built entirely with **Jetpack Compose** to showcase modern UI architecture and navigation using mock movie data. It's perfect for learning how to implement screen transitions, pass arguments, use expandable UI components, and load images with Coil.

> 🚧 **Note:** This app uses **mock data** only. There is no backend/API integration. The purpose is to demonstrate how to build modular, navigable, and visually appealing apps using Jetpack Compose.
